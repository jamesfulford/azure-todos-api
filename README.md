# azure-todos-api
Classic todo API implemented with Azure database for deployment on the cloud. Provides a 'task' resource with basic CRUD abilities.

Completed as part of CSCI-E94 at Harvard University. (Assignment 2)

(I use 'task' and 'todo' interchangeably because 'tasks' already exist in C#. Namespacing helps, but will not solve potential confusion of future developers. I like to code with easy maintainability by another developer in mind. Keep it simple!)
