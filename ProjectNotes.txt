Assignment #2: Tasks API App Service

Here's my swagger UI URL: https://todosapi20190226101920.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html

(Note: Todos and Tasks are the same thing, however "Tasks" in C# already exist (multithreading), so to avoid name conflicts I just use "Todos" wherever I can without breaking the contract specified in the assignment.

I set TodoLimits:MaxTaskEntries to 10.

Right now there are only the seeded todos.
